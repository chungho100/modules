## Sprint Planning Meeting

### Sprint 1 Task Board

The product owner should create a "project" in your GitHub repo with the follownig columns to begin with.

1. Todo
2. In Progress
3. Blocked
4. Done

The leftmost column will contain the user stories that the team has committed to finish by the end of this sprint.

### Create a Scrum Board

Now go through each user story at the top of your stack and do the following: 

1. Product owner presents each story and makes sure everyone knows what that story means.
2. Team agrees to take it on in this sprint or not
	* If the team agrees, add the story to the project board for this sprint, then take the user story and break it down into tasks. Put those tasks in the sprint backlog and be sure to refer to the relevant user story, prioritizing the most important at the top.
	* If the team doesn't agree, figure out where to prioritize it in your stack of user stories. There is no need to break this out into tasks just yet.

### Planning Poker

1. Make flash cards with these numbers on them

 	`0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 40, 100, ? and ∞`

2. Lets calibrate. First the product owner (in this case me) will present each story and explain what it means. The group will ask questions to clarify what exactly the story is. Then we'll have a round of poker.

	> **As a** reader
	>
	> **I want** a website that tells a clear story
	>
	> **So that** I can come away with a better understanding of climate change
	
	Tasks:

	- Decide on a topic area that the group agrees on
	- Decide on which dataset or datasets we will use
	- Find a a few narrative threads within the dataset
	- Tell that story in a word document


	> **As a** design student
	>
	> **I want** to build a website that looks good
	>
	> **So that** I can demonstrate good design principles in my portfolio
	
	Tasks:

	- Create a simple HTML site with navigation between pages
	- Find a color pallette that I like
	- Apply the CSS styles


	> **As a** student doing this project
	>
	> **I want** to customize a visualization that I find on the web
	>
	> **So that** I can demonstrate that I have learned how to learn new technologies
	
	Tasks:
	
	- Find a visualization that fits my dataset
	- Learn how to customize it
	- Customize it to fit the needs of my project

	> **As a** student with a quantiative background
	>
	> **I want** to analyze a dataset for this project
	>
	> **So that** i can have an item demonstrating my quant skills in my portfolio
	
	Tasks:
	
	- Find a dataset
	- Build a predictive model in STATA
1. Now lets do it in the context of a particular group's project. Lets do one or two cards for a volunteer group with the whole class and then we'll break off.
	1. Product owner presents a task
	2. Product owner solicits questions to make sure everyone is on the same page about what is included in that task and what is not.
	3. Poker commences - estimate the size of each story with one of these values
 	`0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 40, 100, ? and ∞` Using the methodology described here: 	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker
	4. Either agree on a consensus, or discuss further and do another round of poker.
2. Now lets turn it over to the groups to do that with the rest of the tasks for this sprint.
