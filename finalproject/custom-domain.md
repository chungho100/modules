# Custom Domains

**Want to serve your website on your very own custom domain name?** You can do that! There are easy ways to either a) connect a particular project repository to a domain name or sub-domain name or b) wire up your GitHub account so that **any** repo you create and serve off GitHub pages automatically is served on that custom domain. Here we're going to explore how to do the former:

**Step 1:** Buy a domain name at your domain vendor of choice, like namecheap.com - and login to the dashboard for that vendor. 

**Step 2:** Follow the steps in GitHub's documentation on [configuring an apex domain](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain). If you'd like to use a subdomain of the domain name you just bot (like `blog.sampledomain.com`) there are [instructions on configuring a subdomain](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-a-subdomain) as well.

**Step 3:** Reflect. Now that you've followed the instructions and (hopefully) got it working. It might be a good time to put the inquisitive skills that you learned in class to use and build a mental model of what you just did. What is an "A record"? What is a "CNAME"?
